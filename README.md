# ðŸš¨ Using this repository (please read) ðŸš¨
Open source is very important to me and I thoroughly support it, but there are times when I question if doing this could put me at a disadvantage. If you are going to use this repository for your own site, please link back to this repository or other forms of attribution. I've spent an enormous amount of time designing my site so that it looks good and I'm thoroughly proud of it. Please, if using this repo for your own website, attribute me in some way.


# Development

For my site, I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to build it.

To get started, run `npm install` in the root of the project.

Then, to see the site, run `npm start`.

All of the source code is in the `src/` directory. All the React components are in the `src/components/` directory.

The CSS is in the `src/components/` directory as well. 

`App.js` is where everything comes together, so if you want to change something, do it there!
